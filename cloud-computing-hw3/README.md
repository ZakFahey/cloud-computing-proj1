# Cloud Computing HW3

Web frontend for cloud computing HW2. Includes a web page with an input to check the forecast on a given date. Also returns a forecast from openweathermap.org.

## Setup

Since this is a static web page, you can simply run it by loading `index.html`. You will also need to run [the API](https://github.com/ZakFahey/cloud-computing-hw2) to receive results. In order to change the API endpoint, you'll need to change the first line of [index.js](src/index.js).
